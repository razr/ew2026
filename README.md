## Abstract

Modern embedded systems often require deterministic real-time performance alongside scalable cloud-native applications. This talk explores deploying workloads across VxWorks RTOS and Linux environments within a Kubernetes cluster, using ROS 2 as a concrete example of a distributed application. We’ll demonstrate how OCI-compliant containers can be built for both RTOS and Linux, enabling mixed-platform orchestration where real-time tasks coexist with general-purpose cloud workloads. A recorded demo will showcase ROS 2 nodes running seamlessly across RTOS and Linux nodes, illustrating practical strategies for bridging embedded determinism with cloud scalability and unified management.
